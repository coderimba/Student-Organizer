# Student Organizer

## Never miss a deadline again!

*Student Organizer* aims to help university students keep track of their never-ending pile of assignments. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has come to my attention that many of my peers are struggling to stay organized, leading to them feeling overwhelmed. This application will help reduce levels of anxiety by allowing students to do the following:
- add new assignments and include
	- a course code (e.g. CPSC 210)
	- a due date
	- an estimated time for completion
- sort outstanding assignments by their fields
- mark assignments as complete

Start using *Student Organizer* today and **never miss a deadline again!**
